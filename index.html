    <p>This is a piece of code that displays the action when the Save button is clicked.
        As you can see from the code, the button is not unique, so an array iteration is used to determine which button is pressed.
        The algorithm described in the code monitors the click of the Save button and performs a number of actions:
        it sends the data entered by the user to the server, hides the save button, activates the edit button,
        makes the input field non-editable,launches a spinner that will run until the data on the page is updated.
