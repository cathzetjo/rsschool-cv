## Summary:
We know that many would like to start a career in IT, 
but they are stopped by a whole set of different factors: 
you need to understand how capable and talented you are for this job, find time to study, 
take good developer courses and not affordable for everyone , then, somehow, without experience, 
find your first job in this area. All this seems almost impossible, especially if you are not already 20 years old. 
But is it really so?
